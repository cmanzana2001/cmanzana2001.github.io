## Tues/Thurs Oct. 7 and 9th
- Continued work on making R script completely functional from start to finish
- Generated Value Function training sample with R script, using small sample of data
- Worked with Andrew set up Amazon EC2 instance for the project 
- Attempted to run this "baby" R script on the Amazon instance, but discovered that the instance runs out of memory
- Am reducing the size of input R objects, which are the apparent cause of the memory issue
