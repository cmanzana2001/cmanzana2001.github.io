- Continued working with Andrew to run R script on EC2 for 1% sample
- Successfully ran R script on EC2 with 1% sample, on m3.2xlarge (provides more than enough RAM)
- Discovered script on 1% sample takes 6GB of RAM (max)
- Began constructing 100% sample to run R script on EC2 and test RAM consumption
